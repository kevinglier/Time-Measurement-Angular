# Time Measurement

**Check the latest build:** https://kevinglier.github.io/Time-Measurement-Angular/dist/index.html

## About

Here we have a small Angular 5 SPA, which enables you to simply track the time for any task you're currently working on.

## Features

1. Table with tracking entries
   - new entries can be added
   - each entry displays
         - the time the task was started
         - the duration the task took
         - a note you define
   - entries can be edited
2. Timer, which can is working in both direction (counting down or up)
   - Task are created automatically with the current time. The duration counts up, when the timer is running
   - The timer can be started, paused or stopped.

## How to continue with this Project

The only tools you need is an text edtior or IDE and NodeJS in a version above 8. If you meet these requirements,
all you have to do is the following:

1. Clone the Repository to the desired location on your computer
2. Open a terminal (eg. Powershell) in the repositories directory and type "npm install"
3. To work and test the application, type "npm run ng serve" or "npm run ng test".
    - With the first command you will get a localhost URL, which you can open up in your browser (somewhat like http://localhost:4200/Time-Measurement-Angular/dist)
